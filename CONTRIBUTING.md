# Contributing to Qontinui API

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use Github Flow

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the project's license

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same license that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report Bugs Using GitHub's Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/jspinak/qontinui-api/issues).

## Write Bug Reports with Detail, Background, and Sample Code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies (see README.md)
3. Run tests to ensure everything is working
4. Make your changes
5. Run tests again to verify your changes

## Code Style

- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Run linters before committing
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Add comments for complex logic

## Community

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
